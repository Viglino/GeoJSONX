# GeoJSONX
*Compress (minify) GeoSJON file*

[GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features. It is widly supported by all major mapping libraries like [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/),  [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) or [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).
Any .geojson file in a GitHub repository are now [automatically rendered as an interactive, browsable map](https://github.blog/2013-06-13-there-s-a-map-for-that/), annotated with your geodata.

But it is awfully inefficient when it comes to storing data.
